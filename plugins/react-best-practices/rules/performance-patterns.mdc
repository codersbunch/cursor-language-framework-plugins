description: React performance optimization patterns to prevent unnecessary re-renders
alwaysApply: true

react-performance:

- Avoid creating new objects or arrays inline in JSX props - they cause re-renders on every render
- Move static data outside components so it is not recreated on every render
- Use useCallback for functions passed as props to memoized child components
- Use useMemo for expensive computations, not for every value
- Avoid anonymous functions in event handlers on frequently rendered lists
- Use React.memo on pure presentational components that receive stable props
- Virtualize long lists with react-window or react-virtual - never render 1000+ DOM nodes
- Avoid deeply nested component trees - flatten where possible
- Use React DevTools Profiler to measure before optimizing - never guess
